### **About me**

I learned information security at the Polytechnic University in St. Petersburg. After university, I worked as a programmer and database administrator. Also I serviced a local network of 30 computers.

After a few years, I became interested in design. I finished some courses in design theory and web design. I worked on the creation of the company's internal website.

I'm studying foreign languages: Italian, Spanish, English.

I am interested in working for foreign companies and customers, because it's an opportunity to develop in the field of web design and web programming, and also in the language field.
